          <p> </p>
          <p>You know about the Cloister of Kaisinel, right? The Empyrean Lord of fantasy and fear resides there. The High Priest of Mirage, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Eremitia] is personally requesting that you appear before Kaisinel.</p>

          <p>The messenger didn't reveal any details. Maybe Kaisinel wants congratulate you on the great job you've been doing. Probably not anything to worry about.</p>

          <p>Use the teleport statue located to the left of [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA30]. Happy trails.</p>

          <p>So you're the one sent by Commander Lavirintos. I've heard a lot about you. The one who doesn't hesitate to protect Elysea from danger.</p>

          <p>Yes. That must be it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have a request. It's just the thing for a young hot-shot with something to prove. That sounds like you, correct?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You weren't told this, but Empyrean Lord Kaisinel is not here. He is off fighting in Inggison, where there is a distinct lack of Aether. You will go help him.</p>
